[35mShould I install both protection upgrades and protection units in an exosuit?[0m
[34m10 months ago[0m

I have two types of technology upgrades available for my exosuit: items listed
as [4mprotection units[24m, and items listed as [4mprotection upgrades[24m. The ones listed as
upgrades have text that generally says something like "an almost total rework of
the <damage type> Protection, this upgrade brings unparalleled improvements to
<damage type> Shielding and <damage type> Protection", whereas the upgrade units
give a percentage of resistance.

Should I install both, or do I just need to install one or the other? For
example:

  * I have a "High-Energy Bio-Integrity Unit" which is a [4mprotection upgrade[24m,
    and I can build a "Radiation Reflector" which is a [4mprotection unit[24m. Should I
    install both?
  * I have a "Specialist De-Toxifier" and I can build a "Toxin Suppressor".
    Should I install both?
  * I have a "Carbon Sublimation Pump" and I can build a "Coolant Network".
    Should I install both?
  * I have a "Nitroged-Based Thermal Stabilizer" and I can build a "Thermic
    Layer". Should I install both?

And then for something similar but a little different:

  * I have a "Deep Water Depth Protection" which says it is an "almost total
    rework of the Aeration Membrance", and I can also build an Aeration
    Membrane. Will crafting and installing an Aeration Membrane bring any extra
    benefits?
