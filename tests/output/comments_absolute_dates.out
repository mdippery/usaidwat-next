I have used it to ask very specific, targeted questions about encounter design,
questions like: I have this encounter, can you think of how to apply Cypher's
mechanics to it? And it's actually notâ€¦bad. It's given me a couple useful ideas
for specific mechanics. It actually understands Cypher fairly well. But it's
also very shallow; the mechanical suggestions it has given me have not been
particularly novel.

I wouldn't use it to run a whole session, let along a campaign. I've found
that it can deal with mechanics fine. I've occasionally followed its prompts to
generate more creative things, just to see what it can doâ€”it knows that I play
tabletop RPGs, so often when I use it to research scientific or philosophical
topics, it ends with a prompt like "Want me to write a short story about that?"
and I've said yes a few times out of curiosity to see what it can produce, and
I've been underwhelmed with the results. It is also subject to a lot of "cross
pollination" across chats and will start to blend in disparate ideas into the
same output, often resulting in gobbledygook or chaos. Very superficial and
shallow "creativity", maybe a starting point, but not a substitute for doing the
creative work yourself.

Besides, why would you want it to?
