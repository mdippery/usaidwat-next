Honestly, min/maxing and system mastery is a big part of the Pathfinder community. It's a fairly crunchy system that draws in the sort of players who really like finding ways to exploit the rules. Supposedly some groups are more focused on roleplaying, but I have yet to meet a PF2 player in real life who gives a shit about pesky, whimsical things like story. If that's not your thing, you probably won't see eye to eye with the Pathfinder players you meet.
I'm in a slightly similar boat right now: I don't care that much about min/maxing, but I put up with my Pathfinder friends because I really like our group and I like them as people well enough.
