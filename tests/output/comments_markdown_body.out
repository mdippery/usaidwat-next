On paper I've always thought that I like the tight balance of games like
Pathfinder. But after playing Pathfinder for a while, I've come to feel that
RPGs are fun when they have a bit of swinginess. The best moments in my 25 years
of playing RPGs have occurred when someone pulled off an amazing crit, or rolled
a natural 1 when they absolutely had to hit the enemy, or failed a save they had
a 90% of passing. Those are the times when the game goes in an interesting, fun,
memorable direction (even if it does occasionally lead to some cheap deaths).

Conversely, Pathfinder plays like a board game. And don't get me wrong, I love
board games, too, but RPGsâ€”even Pathfinderâ€”rarely have enough depth to be an
interesting board game, and so they just play out tediously and predictably. My
Pathfinder group is [4mso good[24m at Pathfinder, we've mastered the system, and as a
consequence, the game is really stale and unchallenging.

(I also have other problems with Pathfinder, like the fact that there is simply
way too much shit to keep track ofâ€¦but I digress.)
