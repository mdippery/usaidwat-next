I wish I hadn't run my Cypher campaign using Cypher.\n\nBy dated, I mean that Numenera was a breath of fresh air when I discovered it 10+ years ago compared to D&amp;D, but there has been a lot of evolution in the TTRPG space since then that I think makes Numenera/Cypher feel very rules-heavy and mechanical in undesirable ways. It's trying to split the difference between being very mechanical and being rules-lite, and it did it decently well for its time, but now it feels a bit clunky.\n\nAnd cyphers are hard to work into a game outside of a fantasy or science fantasy setting (I know there are subtle cyphers but they feel like a hack on top of a system that is clearly designed with fantasy in mind).",

I've also had the experience that every task becomes a negotiation that immediately takes everyone out of the game; you really need players that lean into the narrative aspect, but most RPG players want a game to be a game.\n\nThere are a couple specific points I am a bit curious about, though.\n\n&gt; My players are very creative and try to think outside the box, but the system doesn't allow this; you can only do what your character sheet says.\n\nThe system is fundamentally about using tools, skills, cyphers, and other aids to lower the difficulty of tasks. Generally I've found it allows for a lot of open-ended creativity (too much, I've found—hence why every task becomes a negotiation), and there's so little written on the character sheet that I've generally not found players to be bound by their sheets.\n\n&gt; They simply get another artifact which, while cool (a mind-swapping gun), is unrelated to the narrative.\n\nTrue. Some may argue, but I got this vibe as well. Cyphers are cool, but they're also a little \"lol random\".\n\n&gt; In combat, nanos are useless, and there is no balance in the groups.\n\nI'm a little surprised by this, because I found nanos to be strong…well, everywhere, to the point that I'm not even sure why anyone would pick anything but a nano (except for flavor). Glaive is supposedly the combatant, but it's so overshadowed by the nano in every way that there's virtually no mechanical reason to pick a glaive.\n\n(Did your nanos take Onslaught? It's such a strong offensive ability that it's practically required for nanos, and I can see how they'd be ineffective in combat without it. Scan is basically a requirement as well.)\n\nGenerally, though, I have similar feelings about Numenera: great setting, and theoretically a really fun system, but in practice I just haven't been able to make it work to my satisfaction.",

          "body": "I ran a campaign earlier this year for a while, although ultimately it fell apart. Overall I like the system, but it has its downsides. I found my players weren't that into it, though.\n\n# How'd it go?\n\nIt went…_okay_. I enjoyed running it, and a few of the players really liked it, but others weren't really into it. We used the \"lifepath\" method of character generation, and my players _really_ liked that—even though it takes a lot of time—but a few were less enthusiastic about the game itself.\n\n# What kind of game did you do?\n\nLow-magic fantasy, partly because I didn't find a satisfactory way to feature magic in the system. There are various methods out there, _Tales of Xadia_ being one that is particularly well developed, but none of them really grabbed me.\n\n# What Prime Sets did you use for your game?\n\nDistinctions (of course), affiliations, skills with specialties, and signature assets.\n\nAffiliations were a great choice. My game had a bit of political intrigue, and affiliations added to that atmosphere.\n\nI would recommend having skills. It made the character creation a lot more time consuming (more options). If I had to do it again, I think roles are a much better choice. They can kind of mimic classes and allow players to \"multiclass\" without the complication of individual skill selection. If you're coming from other games, you're probably going to be drawn to using skills, but take my advice and consider roles instead.\n\nSignature assets are…cool, but they might be a bit freeform for many players. Choose this option with caution (they do make characters really unique, though).\n\n# Was there anything that the system did really well?\n\nSocial encounters, certainly. Character creation was a lot of fun. We didn't do a lot of combat; I have a suspicion combat would not be satisfying to my players in Cortex, but it never came up in practice anyway.\n\nI did not use the trauma rules, but if you are going to feature combat, I think the trauma rules are really important. I'd probably implement those if I played my game again.\n\n# Was there anything at which the system was just…meh, or bad?\n\nCortex is really a gaming toolkit, not a game itself, so you have to do a lot of legwork to set up a game (there aren't a lot of third-party settings, either). And that can be a lot of work. I think one of the drawbacks of the system is that the Cortex Prime rulebook presents a _ton_ of interesting options, but it doesn't provide a lot of guidance on how all of those options fit together, so you have to figure out yourself what works best for your game. That means that you're probably going to feel like you're playtesting your game for a while, and I didn't particularly like that. But on the other hand, the system does allow you to tailor a game almost exactly to your liking.\n\nThe Cortex Prime Discord channel has a lot of friendly, helpful people, too. Unfortunately, I didn't find a lot of guidance there on the best assembly of options for my game, because everyone had their own opinion on what worked best!\n\nAll that's to say that you're kind of on your own as far as actually designing your game goes.\n\nNow, the highlights: Cortex Prime does drama and social encounters really well, so if you want a game that features those over combat, I think it's a great choice.\n\n# What suggestions do you have based on your experience?\n\nI listed some above, but I'll repeat them here for brevity:\n\n1. Consider roles over skills. It makes character creation a lot simpler.\n2. Fewer trait sets are better. There are tons of options in the book, but try to find a minimal set that distills the essence of your game the best. More does not equal better in this case!\n3. The lifepath method of character creation is hella fun, one of the best RPG experiences I have ever had—but it's very time consuming. Budget a lot of time for it—it takes longer than you think! Also, if you have creative players, they will start bending the lifepath rules a lot. Don't stop their fun, but try to keep them in line—otherwise it can get out of control.\n4. If your game is going to feature combat, use the trauma rules.\n5. Signature assets really make characters unique—but it's an additional trait set, so include this in your game wisely.",

But that's probably not enough to sell you on them.\n\nThere are some dice pool mechanics that make sense from a statistics standpoint. 3d6 gives a nicer bell curve than a single d20, so you have more reliability in your rolls (and can build a character around that). In essence, more dice = less variability. Of course, at a certain point, that becomes unwieldy, and furthermore, RPGs are more fun when you have _some_ variability.\n\nThere are some dice pool mechanics, like Cortex, where you mix dice of different sizes, which can allow for some cool mechanics (Cortex has effect dice which allow for some neat things), although I haven't done a rigorous analysis to see how that affects rolls from a statistical standpoint, although I imagine simpler systems can produce similar statistical outcomes. Maybe someone from /r/TheyDidTheMath can help me out.\n\nThen you have systems like Forbidden Lands (and I think other Free League games, although I'm only familiar with Forbidden Lands) where you have a huge handful of dice, and so you need a lot of them, in different colors, and while the mechanism is a bit unwieldy, it does have some cool interactions with the mechanics of the game. And it's also fun to roll a handful of many-colored dice.

          "body": "I have been running a Cypher campaign for a while and I have mixed feelings about it. Some of those are due to personal preferences or group preferences and not really a critique of the system itself, but I have some issues with the mechanics. I'll get the issues related to preferences out of the way first; they might be interesting to discuss but they're not really relevant to any criticism of the mechanics.\n\n# Personal Issues\n\nTheoretically I like the character creation system of Cypher, but in practice, it doesn't jive with my personal tastes. I don't really like playing \"superheroes\"; I like grittier, down to earth characters (more Mothership, less D&amp;D). Cypher characters are the epitome of unique superheroes: they are powerful, and each has a focus that is supposed to be unique within the group. Just not the type of game I like to run right now.\n\nAlso, I forget to give out GM intrusions a lot. The system doesn't work well without them. That's on me, but it is another thing I have to remember.\n\n# Group Issues\n\nThe core mechanic of Cypher hinges on using skills, tools, and attribute points to lower the difficulty of tasks. Turns out my group is a bunch of rules lawyers, and almost every task becomes a negotiation over whether a tool or a skill _could_ be used for some unintended purpose to lower the task difficulty. As a GM, it gets tiring after a while, even if it is all in good fun. This is not an indictment of the system per se, but much like [Fate](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1h7h1yb/what_is_the_worst_generic_system_in_your_opinion/m0l90cm/), the system only really works if the players get out of their rules-oriented mindset and into a narrative mindset. My players _insisted_ they like a fiction-forward game, but it turns out they were wrong.\n\n# Mechanical Issues\n\n* **Cyphers:** Cyphers are the core of the game, but they only really work well in Numenera. They don't translate to other settings that well—but you have to have them because they're the crux of the game. Cypher introduces \"subtle cyphers\" which I have found to just be a half-baked solution to the problem.\n* **Skills:** The skill system sucks. It basically becomes \"take the least restrictive skill your GM will let you take\", which is fine if your players are focused on the narrative, as noted above, but not if they're rules lawyers. Also, there's no singular, definitive list of skills, but I have found that players are lost without a skill list (again, might be an issue with _my_ players), so GMs often have to generate one…which means they just use the example in the rulebook, anyway.\n* **Foci:** Some are just clearly better than others, mechanically…and if your players are rules lawyers, they will pepper you with questions about why certain foci even exist. Again, if your players are fiction-forward, that's not an issue, but I find that despite Internet memes to the contrary, most RPG players still have a gamist perspective. I also find that even from a fictional perspective, foci are often very restrictive, and it's hard to make the type of character I want (also, personal preference again, but I'm not into superheroes).\n\nDespite a few flaws, I still think the system is _okay_, and it was pretty good back in 2015, when I started with Numenera and The Strange…but I think there are better systems out there nowadays.\n\nAnyway, those are a few of my thoughts off the top of my head. Maybe more will come to me later.\n\n# Addenda: Numenera\n\nI should add that I think Numenera is a really cool setting and its rules work fairly well _for its setting_. I don't think they translate to a generic game that well.",

          "body": "Pathfinder has clearer and more specific rules, but that's a source of its complication: there are lots of rules to know. Even social skills and actions have very specific rules. Moreover, because Pathfinder uses graduated success/failure, you potentially have to know four possible outcomes for each action or spell: critical success, success, failure, and critical failure. This is a cool mechanic, but it means you frequently have to look up the details for an action. If it's an action or spell you use a lot, you'll probably memorize it quickly, but there's always a few times a session where someone uses a rarely-used action and no one can quite remember what happens on a critical failure—if anything happens at all, since not everything has a critical success/failure result.\n\nSimilarly, there are lots of conditions with very specific rules. And that's great in the sense that there's little ambiguity in how to apply the condition, but conditions occur frequently, and they can be a lot to track. Especially when you're dealing with the interactions between conditions, and especially when you have unusual combinations of conditions. For example, in a recent game, my character was sickened, underwater, so I had to track how much air she had remaining, _and_ apply the sickened rules, which also meant taking into account the fact that you can't retch underwater (or maybe you can, but with some sort of penalty—see, I can't even remember, even now). And our spellcasters had to know that they can't cast spells with verbal components underwater, lest they immediately expend all of their air. Not a problem if you often fight underwater, but we don't, so it was a bunch of rules we had to quickly look up.\n\nSo sure, if you boil the core mechanics down to \"just apply a +1 mod here and there\" then yeah, I guess it's simple, but that's like saying that D&amp;D is just a matter of \"roll a d20 and apply advantage/disadvantage\", which is eliding a ton of rules. And in games like Pathfinder and D&amp;D, every class is essentially its own set of rules, every spell is its own set of rules, every condition is its own set of rules, every item is its own set of rules… There's a fair amount to know, some of which you will certainly memorize after a while, but some of which is used only rarely and thus needs to be looked up.\n\nThat's why I don't think it's inaccurate to describe Pathfinder as \"complicated\".",
